# Formative2_Data_Preprocessing

## Description
The steps in this exercise focus on data preprocessing. We have used tools and techniques like KNNs, GANs, and PCA to preprocess the data. The data is ralated to customer trnasactions and we have to preprocess the data to make it ready for further analysis/training.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries using the following command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the first notebook `preprocessing_1.ipynb` to preprocess the data using KNNs and GANs.
4. Run the second notebook `preprocessing_2.ipynb` to preprocess the data using PCA.
5. The data will be saved in the `derived_datasets` folder.
6. Run the third notebook `preprocessing_3.ipynb` to clean the data and save it in the `data`.
